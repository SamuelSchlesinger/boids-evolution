# boids-evolution

A hacky version of boids I made and will likely try to improve on. My very first big
programming project was a boids variant where I incorporated a genetic algorithm which
learned the best parameters for the boid constants as well as some other things. I want
to remake something like that but perhaps with neural nets or something fun.
